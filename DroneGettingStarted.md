## Build your own drone
An almost ready-to-fly drone kit compatible with Qualcomm Flight Pro™ and [Qualcomm Navigator](https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/qualcomm-navigator)™ called the [Dragon Drone Development Kit](https://worldsway.com/product/dragon-drone-development-kit) is now available. See [this post](https://developer.qualcomm.com/forum/qdn-forums/hardware/snapdragon-flight/34688) for more information. This is the *recommended* option.

Please refer to [snav_vehicle](https://github.com/ATLFlight/snav_vehicles) for SNAV params and ESC flashing instructions.  

If you're using ROS, [qflight_descriptions](https://github.com/ATLFlight/qflight_descriptions) has URDFs for the different drone configurations.  Use "board=sdf_pro" for the Qualcomm Flight Pro board.

Also make sure to look at the open source ROS software that supports the Qualcomm Flight Pro: [ROS Software](RosSoftware.md)
